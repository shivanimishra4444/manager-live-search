## Manager Filter
- User sees full lists of managers on clicking input field

- Lists shows a max of two but can be scrolled

- Matching results appear according to input query

- Highlighted manager is selected when user hits enter key in input field

- User can navigate list using up and down arrows- I haven't done that

- Entered value is retained on losing focus, filter reapplied once focus is back.
